I have implemented as much as possible but it was becoming a very long project. So Instead i have completed following.
- I have built music player
    - It can pause
    - It can seek using slider.
    - It can increase decrease volume.
    - It can play 4 songs in latest release songs.
- single artist page
    - Only opens when clicked on coldplay.
- responsive
    - i have made aside queue to come from the side by clicking on the queue button on player controls
    - i have made nav in a hamburger menu.
