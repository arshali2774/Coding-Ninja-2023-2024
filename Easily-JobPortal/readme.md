# Easily - Job Portal

## Goal

- Develop a job portal website that allows recruiters to post and manage job listings and provides a user-friendly platform for job seekers to find and apply for suitable roles.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Implement an MVC (Model View Controller) architecture with ExpressJS to separate data handling, interface rendering, and routing control.
2. Implement EJS for server-side templating, providing dynamic HTML generation based on server data.
3. Utilize ES6 Modules to maintain code modularity and organization.
4. Use Express sessions for managing user sessions and a cookie-based tracking of the last visit.
5. Use in-memory data structures for user and job management operations.
6. Implement a login and registration system, allowing recruiters to create and log into their accounts.
7. Allow job seekers to view all jobs, view details of a specific job, and apply to a job by providing their details.
8. Allow recruiters to create, update, delete, and view job postings, with necessary validation for each field in the job posting.
9. Enable recruiters to view all applicants of a job, including their submitted resume files.
10. Implement an email system to send confirmation emails to applicants after they apply to a job.
11. Use middleware for handling authentication, tracking of the last visit, file upload processing, and sending confirmation emails.
12. Store the resume files on the server using a file upload middleware.
13. Ensure original and high-quality code with comprehensive documentation.

## Steps to follow

Follow the following steps to build the project.

1. Set up an Express.js application and its related configurations.
2. Install necessary project dependencies based on the functionalities required.
3. Configure EJS as the templating engine and create views for job seekers to browse all jobs, view details of a job, apply to jobs, and recruiters to create, update, delete, and view
   their job postings.
4. Create a User model with functions for getting all the users, adding a user, and confirming user login.
5. Create a User controller to interface with the User model and handle user registration, login, and logout.
6. Create a Job model with functions for creating a new job, retrieving all jobs, finding a job by its id, updating a job, adding a new applicant to a job, retrieving all applicants for a
   job, and deleting a job.
7. Create a Job controller to interface with the Job model to create, update and delete jobs, and to manage job applicants.
8. Implement routes for user registration, login, logout, job operations including creating, updating, and deleting job postings, and to fetch necessary views.
9. Implement a session based user authentication and management system for recruiters.
10. Set up middleware to handle resume uploads using Multer, send confirmation emails after applying for a job using Nodemailer, and to track a user's last visit using cookies.
11. Document the application explaining functionalities, dependencies, and code organization for easy understanding of the codebase.

## Additional Tasks

You can add the following functionality to the project to maximize your score.

1. Implement job search functionality to allow users to filter jobs with the search input in the navbar.
2. Redirect Recruiters to the all jobs page if they are already logged in instead of showing login/register options.
3. Implement resource-based authorization so that only the recruiter who posted a job can update or delete it.
4. Display the user's last visit date and time on the frontend to provide personalized information.
5. Add confirmation dialogs for update and delete operations to prevent accidental modifications.
6. Implement a common validation middleware for consistent form validation across the application.
7. Implement pagination for job listings and applicant lists to improve performance.
